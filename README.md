# boomtown

Saturday:
bootstrap template added.
	-addded node modules:
		gulp, gul-sass
		jquery
		(a few others that came with template)

We can do the whole thing in sass!!! Which is awesome.

I'm going to make us a trello and some cards becuase I'm having a hard time keeping myself on track.  There are a lot of rabbit holes to dive down with this project.  We definately need a good way to focus on MVP
