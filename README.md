Sunday:

finished backend and front end, separately.

If you want to start up the server and stuff on your own machine, first create a DB with psql and change ---> /models/index.js to reflect your username and DB name.. Then run node/db/dbSetup.js and node/db/seed.js

you can use postman to add surveys and users and whatnot but its kind of confusing without reading and understadning how all the routes work.
